Description: Lambert W x F distributions are a generalized framework to analyze
    skewed, heavy-tailed data. It is based on an input/output system, where the
    output random variable (RV) Y is a non-linearly transformed version of an input
    RV X ~ F with similar properties as X, but slightly skewed (heavy-tailed).
    The transformed RV Y has a Lambert W x F distribution. This package contains
    functions to model and analyze skewed, heavy-tailed data the Lambert Way:
    simulate random samples, estimate parameters, compute quantiles, and plot/
    print results nicely. The most useful function is 'Gaussianize',
    which works similarly to 'scale', but actually makes the data Gaussian.
    A do-it-yourself toolkit allows users to define their own Lambert W x
    'MyFavoriteDistribution' and use it in their analysis right away.
