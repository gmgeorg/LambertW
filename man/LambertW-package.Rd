\title{R package for Lambert W\eqn{ \times} F distributions}
\description{
This package is based on notation, definitions, and results of Goerg (2011,
    2015, 2016).  I will not include these references in the description of
    each single function.

Lambert W\eqn{ \times} F distributions are a general framework to model and
    transform skewed, heavy-tailed data. Lambert W\eqn{ \times} F random
    variables (RV) are based on an input/ouput system with input RV \eqn{X
    \sim F_X(x \mid \boldsymbol \beta)} and output \eqn{Y}, which is a
    non-linearly transformed version of X -- with similar properties to X,
    but slightly skewed and/or heavy-tailed.  Then Y has a 'Lambert W
    \eqn{\times F_X}' distribution - see References.

\code{\link{get_distnames}} lists all implemented Lambert W \eqn{\times} F
    distributions in this package. If you want to generate a
    skewed/heavy-tailed version of a distribution that is not implemented,
    you can use the do-it-yourself modular toolkit
    (\code{\link{create_LambertW_input}} and
    \code{\link{create_LambertW_output}}). It allows users to quickly
    implement their own Lambert W x 'MyFavoriteDistribution' and use it in
    their analysis right away.

This package contains several functions to analyze skewed and heavy-tailed
    data: simulate random samples (\code{\link{rLambertW}}), evaluate pdf and
    cdf (\code{\link{dLambertW}} and \code{\link{pLambertW}}), estimate
    parameters (\code{\link{IGMM}} and \code{\link{MLE_LambertW}}), compute
    quantiles (\code{\link{qLambertW}}), and plot/print results nicely
    (\code{\link{plot.LambertW_fit}}, \code{\link{print.LambertW_fit}},
    \code{\link{summary.LambertW_fit}}).

Probably the most useful function is \code{\link{Gaussianize}}, which works
    similarly to \code{\link[base]{scale}}, but makes your data Gaussian (not
    just centers and scales it, but also makes it symmetric and removes
    excess kurtosis).

If you use this package in your work please cite it
    (\code{citation("LambertW")}).  You can also send me an implementation of
    your 'Lambert W \eqn{\times} YourFavoriteDistribution' to add to the
    \pkg{LambertW} package (and I will reference your work introducing your
    'Lambert W \eqn{\times} YourFavoriteDistribution' here.)

Feel free to contact me for comments, suggestions, code improvements,
    implementation of new input distributions, bug reports, etc.
