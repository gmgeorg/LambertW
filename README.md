# LambertW R package

This is the github repo for the **LambertW** R package [hosted on
CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=LambertW). 

Current version on CRAN is `0.6.4`. The version here is an update to `0.6.5` --
not yet pushed to CRAN as I ran into `Rcpp` issues related to the `useDynLib`
NAMESPACE issues ([issue here](https://github.com/gmgeorg/LambertW/issues/1))

Once this is resolved I will push this to CRAN again (pending unit tests passing
after Rcpp fixes).
